# Employee Directory

## Description
A simple React app you can use to keep track of employee information easily. You can add new employees and sort and/or filter them using the options just above the employee list.

## Table of Contents
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Usage
Employees can be added via the 'Add Employee' form at the top of the page. All fields must be filled out in order for the employee to be added into the database.

Employees can then be filtered by any of their fields, including multiple fields at once. Note how on the salary field, one of the greater than or less than radio buttons must be checked, so it knows in what direction employee salaries must be filtered by.

Finally, you can sort the employees by any of their fields using the up and down arrows next to each of the columns. Click an arrow multiple times to change which direction it should sort that field by.
